# Yosef-Yaynishet-Gebreyesus

Howdy!<br>
My name is Yosef Gebreyesus, and I am a Ph.D. student at [Texas A&M University](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=texas+a%26m+university&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I obtained my MSc and BSc degrees from the [Technion Israeli Institue of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/about/) in Civil and Environmental Engineering. My research during my master's degree was focusing on the effect of steel fibers on  crack localisation on normal reinforced concrete beams <br>

With strong background in Structural Engineering, my PhD research focuses on the vulnerability assessment of aging wooden residential buildings subjected to seismic hazards. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Koliou](https://engineering.tamu.edu/civil/profiles/koliou-maria.html) on a NSF CAREER-funded project.
